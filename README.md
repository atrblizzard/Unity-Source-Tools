# Unity-Source-Tools
Plugin to import resources from the Source engine in Unity3D.

## Instructions:

  **Step 1**: Load scene respective to what game you are extracting from, and click the WorldManager gameobject.

  **Step 2**: Set the Export Location to where you would want to export the map.(This is optional)

  **Step 3**: Set Map Name to the name of your map you want to import.

  **Step 4**: Set Model Name to the name of your model you want to import(untested).

  **Step 5**: Tick "Load Map" or "Load Model", depending on what you're doing.

  **Step 6**: Tick Skip Sky. Otherwise, your sky will be full of garbage.

  **Step 7**: Scroll down to uSrcSettings.

  **Step 8**: Set the Path to wherever your game folder is(example: D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GarrysMod )

  **Step 9**: Depending on what you're doing, adjust the game, have mod, and mod settings. ![Example for Garrysmod](https://i.imgur.com/H4dKv2z.png) (This makes the script look for materials/models in D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod)

  **Step 10**: Tick Textures, Displacements, Props, Props Dynamic, Entities, and Gen Colliders. Do not tick Lightmaps.

That should work! If I got this wrong, please leave an issue.
